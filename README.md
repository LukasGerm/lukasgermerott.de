## Purpose of this project

This is my website which I see as a personal project. I have a roadmap of features I want to implement. 
Also this was my first time of using remix in a project. 

## Project setup

1. You have to run `yarn install`
2. To run the app you have to run `yarn run dev` and `yarn run watch:css` seperately.
3. Also make sure to create a `.env` file which has to contain the following properties
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CODE` -> Google analytics key (optional).
